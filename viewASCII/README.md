## Introduction

   This program views characters and allows you to put your mouse over
any character and see what code is used for that character. Pretty simple.

The program is called viewASCII but will display whatever characters your
console or terminals use(dependant on the font and codepage). You can also
change the font while the program is active to see what characters a font
uses. Refer to the documentation of your terminal (emulator) or console
to see how to do this.

Just press any key or click to exit. Clicking for some odd reason does not
work correctly.

The program is open source under GNU GPL v3.

## Platforms

The program was tested on Windows, but should work on all other platforms too.
However, I cannot guarantee this.

## Known Issues

   The program will often freeze when it is clicked on with a mouse. Am not sure
why this is happening, but must be someting stupid I overlooked.

## Credits/Author

   The only author of this program is me, Dejan Boras. All units used, aside
from those in the FPC RTL are my own.
